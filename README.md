# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
Brain Tumor Detection is a crucial task in the medical imaging Domain.In this task, i have trained two deep learning models to compare the performance in brain tumor detection.First is a simple Convnet and second is a Lenet architecture based model<br/>

The accuracy of CONVNet is around 86% while testing performance is around 77%.<br/>
In LeNET, accuracy is around 91% while testing performance is around 81%.
